# CharacterProfileApp
An app to hold all your heroes, villains, etc. for D&amp;D, book ideas, games, and other things.

# Getting started
1. Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/IAMZERG/CharacterProfileApp
```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio
3. Download the needed dependencies using associated NuGet Package Manager command for your version (depending on the version you have, you may be just fine hitting 'F5' to build the project)
```
c:\proj\app\> nuget restore
c:\proj\app\> nuget.exe restore app.sln
c:\proj\> nuget restore app
```
Or, for you lazy folks, go ahead and use the GUI.
